I hold M.Sc. degree in Information Systems and Technology from [Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en). Prior to that, I did B.S. at the
[University of Turkish Aeronautical Association](https://www.thk.edu.tr/en/homepage/) at the department of Mechatronics Engineering, focusing on Robotics. My main research during M.Sc. is focused on remote sensing, particularly on Automated Remote Sensing Forest Inventory Using Satellite Images. I am currently working as a Data Scientist at [NeurodataLab LLC](https://neurodatalab.com/)
