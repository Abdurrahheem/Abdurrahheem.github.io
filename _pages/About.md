Hey here, I am  Abduragim! I am interested in Computer Vision and Baysian Deep Learning. I love training small models on large datasets :) Here is what I have been up to so far: I hold an M.Sc. degree in Information Systems and Technology from [Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/en). And I did B.S. at the [University of Turkish Aeronautical Association](https://www.thk.edu.tr/en/homepage/) at the Department of Mechatronics Engineering, focusing on Robotics. My primary research during M.Sc. was focused on remote sensing, particularly on Automated Remote Sensing Forest Inventory Using Satellite Images. 

I am currently working as a research Data Scientist at [O.Vision](https://neurodatalab.com/), here we develop fast and rubost biometric algorithms for payments and pesses using Deep Learning. Prior to that I  worked at [NeurodataLab LLC](https://neurodatalab.com/), where I depeloped algorithms for add recall predicition besed on facial emotions of respondents. While I was a student, I managed to squeeze a couple of internships abroad one of which wat at [German Orbital Systems](https://www.orbitalsystems.de/), there I developed testbed for Attitude Determination and Control System for small cubesats satellites.
