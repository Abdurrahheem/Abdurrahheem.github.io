Hey! Thanks for stopping by 👋

<br>
I am second year Ph.D. student at [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae), Abu Dhabi, UAE advised by [Prof. Martin Takac](https://mtakac.com), [Prof. Eric Moulines](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=_XE1LvQAAAAJ&hl=en). Previously, I completed M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at [Skoltech](https://new.skoltech.ru/en/), Moscow, Russia. I hold a B.Sc. in Robotics.


<br>
I am interested in Bayesin Inverse problems with diffusion priors and more broadly interested in probabilistic generative modeling, stochastic processses and their application in real-world problems such as computer vision 👀, drug discovery 🧬, and beyond. 

Also, I am a big fan of open-source software and try to contribute to the community whenever I can. Specifically, I am helping develop and maintain [OpenCV](https://opencv.org), the world's most popular computer vision library 🔥
